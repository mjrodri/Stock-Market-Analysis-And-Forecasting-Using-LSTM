# Stock Market Analysis and Forecasting with LSTM

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for stock market analysis and forecasting. The implementation uses technology stocks, including Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, as case studies. The goal is to analyze historical stock prices, visualize trends, and build an LSTM model to predict future stock prices.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval:** Historical stock data is retrieved using the `yfinance` library, covering a specified time range.

- **Data Visualization:** Seaborn and Matplotlib are employed to visualize historical stock prices, trends, and relevant indicators.

- **Data Preprocessing:** The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, scale the data, and organize it into sequences suitable for LSTM training.

- **LSTM Model:** A deep learning model is built using the LSTM architecture, featuring LSTM layers and dense layers for predicting future stock prices.

- **Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained on historical stock data, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).

- **Forecasting:** The trained LSTM model is used to make predictions on future stock prices, offering insights into potential trends.

- **Visualization of Predictions:** Actual and predicted stock prices are visualized to assess the accuracy of the model's forecasting capabilities.

- **Risk Analysis:** The project includes an analysis of the risk associated with a stock based on its historical performance and predicted future prices.
